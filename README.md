# Texture Packer Exporter for Libdragon 

The exporter generates a texture accepted by Libdragon, and a header file you can use to get the indexes of the images and load the images as ```sprite_t*```.

---

## Installation

You can follow instructions on how to set a custom exporter directory [here](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/documentation/custom-exporter#preparations).

After that you can clone the repo inside your custom exporter directory and select Libdragon as your exporter inside the tool.

## How to Import the Texture

You can import the texture by using ```mksprite``` to generate the ```*.sprite``` file and ```mkdfs``` to generate the ```packed_files.dfs``` file, after that you can use ```n64tool``` to import it.

If you are using Makefile to create your ROM, you can change add these lines to create the sprite file:

```
#$(MKSPRITEPATH) [bits] [columns] [rows] [source.png] [destination.sprite]
packed_files.dfs:
	mkdir -p res
	$(MKSPRITEPATH) 16 7 1 ./path_to_texture_dir/your_texture_name.png ./res/your_texture_name.sprite
	$(MKDFSPATH) packed_files.dfs ./res/
```

And change the existing line to the one below to import the file into the binary:

```
$(N64TOOL) $(N64_FLAGS) -t $(PROG_TAG) $(PROG_NAME).bin -s 1M packed_files.dfs
```

You can also use it in a different way by following [this tutorial](https://www.christopherbonhage.com/software/2017/06/07/flappy-bird-nintendo-64-part-3.html).

## Remarks

Be sure to have textures of same width and height for it to be imported correctly by Libdragon.
